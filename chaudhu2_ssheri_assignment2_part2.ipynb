    "# **PART II:** Theoretical Part – Autoencoders for Anomaly Detection in Manufacturing [20 pts]\n",
    "\n",
    "In manufacturing industries, ensuring the quality of products is important. Detecting anomalies or defects in the production process can be challenging, especially in large-scale operations. Traditional methods often rely on manual inspection or rule-based systems, which can be time-consuming and prone to human error. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Scenario:** A manufacturing company “ElectroGuard Innovations” produces electronic components, and they want to improve their quality control process by implementing an automated anomaly detection system. The company collects sensor data from the production line, which includes various parameters such as temperature, pressure, and voltage readings. Anomalies in these readings could indicate potential defects in the components. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective:** To develop an automated anomaly detection system using an autoencoder neural network to identify defects in the manufacturing process."
